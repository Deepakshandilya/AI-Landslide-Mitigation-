# AI-Landslide-Mitigation-
Here's a *summary* of the code for landslide detection using Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) along with explanations for each section of the code:

1. **Import Libraries**: Import necessary libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and others for data analysis and machine learning.

2. **Define File Path**: Set the file path to the location of your dataset, which appears to be a Jupyter Notebook file (`iit-mandi.ipynb`) on your desktop.

3. **List Files in Directory**: Use the `os.walk` function to list all the files in the specified directory (in your case, the Jupyter Notebook file).

4. **Import Additional Libraries**: Import scitime for measuring the time complexity of machine learning algorithms.

5. **Read Data**: Load the dataset from the specified path into a Pandas DataFrame (`df`).

6. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Check the basic information about the DataFrame using `df.info()`.
   - Rearrange columns to put the target variable (`'Landslide'`) at the end of the DataFrame.
   - Display summary statistics for the DataFrame.
   - Check the number of unique labels in each column.
   - Visualize the frequency distribution of the `'Landslide'` column using a bar plot.
   - Save the bar plot as an EPS file.
   - Repeat the above steps for other columns like `'Precipitation'`, `'Lithology'`, and categorical columns using pie charts.
   - Visualize relationships between `'Landslide'` and `'NDWI'` using a swarm plot.
   - Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between features.

7. **Feature Importance using Mutual Information Classification**:
   - Split the data into training and validation sets.
   - Calculate mutual information scores between features and the target variable `'Landslide'`.
   - Visualize the mutual information scores as a bar plot.

8. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create frequency-encoded features for selected categorical columns such as `'Aspect'`, `'Curvature'`, etc.
   - Group these frequency-encoded features and the target variable into separate DataFrames.
   - Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between the frequency-encoded features.

9. **Feature Selection using PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**:
   - Import PCA from the `pca` library.
   - Prepare the data for PCA by removing the target variable.
   - Initialize the PCA model and fit it to the data.
   - Get the top features contributing to variance.
   - Plot the PCA results in 2D and 3D space.

10. **Save Visualizations**: Save the generated visualizations as EPS files.

This code appears to be a comprehensive data analysis and preprocessing script for landslide detection, including EDA, feature engineering, feature selection using PCA, and visualization of data and results. It also uses various machine learning libraries for analysis and modeling, with a focus on Gradient Boosting for classification.

*PROCESS*

üîç Data Preprocessing:
Objective: Prepare the dataset for model training.
1.	Load Data: The code begins by loading a dataset (df) that presumably contains features and a target variable ('Landslide').
2.	Target Variable Separation: y = df.Landslide assigns the 'Landslide' column to the variable y. This represents the target variable that we want to predict.
3.	Feature Selection: df1 = df.loc[:, df.columns != 'Landslide'] creates a new dataframe (df1) excluding the 'Landslide' column. This separates feature variables from the target variable.
4.	Train-Test Split: X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df1, y, test_size=0.2) splits the dataset into training and testing sets. X_train and X_test contain the feature variables, while y_train and y_test contain the target variable. The split ratio is 80% training and 20% testing.

üõ†Ô∏è Baseline Model Creation and Evaluation:
Objective: Create and evaluate baseline models for GBM, LGBM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM.
5.	Baseline GBM Model: baseline_gbm = GradientBoostingClassifier(...) creates a baseline Gradient Boosting Classifier with default hyperparameters and trains it on the training data.
6.	GBM Model Evaluation: print('Accuracy of the GBM on test set: {:.3f}'.format(baseline_gbm.score(X_test, y_test))) prints the accuracy of the baseline GBM model on the test set. It also calculates and prints a classification report, including precision, recall, F1-score, and support metrics.
7.	Baseline LGBM Model: baseline_lgbm = LGBMClassifier(...) creates a baseline Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) Classifier with default hyperparameters and trains it on the training data.
8.	LGBM Model Evaluation: Repeat the evaluation steps as in line 6 for the baseline LGBM model.
9.	Random Forest and XGBoost Models: Create Random Forest and XGBoost models with default hyperparameters and evaluate their performance, similar to GBM and LGBM.
10.	Ensemble Model (Voting Classifier): Create an ensemble model that combines the Gradient Boosting and Random Forest models using a soft voting strategy. Evaluate its performance on the test set.
11.	SVM Model: Create an SVM Classifier and evaluate its performance on the test set.
12.	Ensemble Model with SVM: Create an ensemble model that combines the Gradient Boosting and SVM models and evaluate its performance.

üîç Hyperparameter Tuning:
Objective: Fine-tune hyperparameters for GBM and LGBM models.
13.	Hyperparameter Tuning (GBM): Tune hyperparameters for the GBM model using GridSearchCV. This step searches for the best combination of hyperparameters, including learning rate, number of estimators, max depth, etc.
14.	Hyperparameter Tuning (LGBM): Perform hyperparameter tuning for the LGBM model using GridSearchCV, similar to the GBM model.
15.	Optimal Parameters: Display the optimal hyperparameters found for GBM and LGBM models after tuning.

üî¨ Evaluation of Tuned Models:
Objective: Evaluate the tuned GBM and LGBM models on the test set.
16.	Evaluate Tuned Models (GBM): Create and evaluate a new GBM model using the optimal hyperparameters on the test set. Print its accuracy and classification report.
17.	Evaluate Tuned Models (LGBM): Create and evaluate a new LGBM model using the optimal hyperparameters on the test set. Print its accuracy and classification report.

üìä Comparison of ROC AUC:
Objective: Compare the ROC AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve) of different models.
18.	ROC AUC Analysis (GBM): Compare the ROC AUC curves of the baseline GBM, Model 1 GBM, and the final GBM model. The curves illustrate the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.
19.	ROC AUC Analysis (LGBM): Repeat the ROC AUC analysis for LGBM models.
20.	Final Accuracy Comparison: Print the accuracy of all models on the test set for both GBM and LGBM.

üßê Feature Selection 
21. Feature Selection Importance: Feature selection is crucial in improving model performance by selecting the most relevant features while eliminating noise and reducing model complexity. It helps in preventing overfitting and improving model generalization.
Recommendation: In the code, feature selection is not explicitly performed. Consider utilizing techniques such as Mutual Information, Feature Importance from tree-based models, or Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select the most informative features for your model.

 üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
22. Importance of EDA: EDA provides valuable insights into the dataset, helps in understanding its characteristics, and aids in making informed decisions during preprocessing and modeling.
Recommendation: Incorporate EDA steps into your workflow, including:
‚Ä¢	Summary Statistics: Calculate basic statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation for each feature.
‚Ä¢	Data Distribution Plots: Visualize feature distributions with histograms or density plots.
‚Ä¢	Correlation Analysis: Examine feature correlations to identify potential multicollinearity.
‚Ä¢	Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers if they exist in the dataset.

üîÑ Mutual Information (if relevant) 
23.Understanding Mutual Information: Mutual information measures the dependency between two variables. It can be used for feature selection by quantifying the information gain between a feature and the target variable.
Recommendation: If you intended to use Mutual Information for feature selection, include code to calculate and evaluate the mutual information scores between features and the target variable. This can help in identifying the most informative features for your model.
By incorporating these improvements into your machine learning workflow, you can enhance your model's performance and make more informed decisions during the data preprocessing and modeling stages. üìàüìäüîç
